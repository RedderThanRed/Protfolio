# My Protfolio

## My portfolio has been developed over the past 2 months. 

For the moment, the portfolio includes a mix of *jquery* and *vanilla* javascript. 

Projects currently being worked (in order of priority) are: 

   <br>Mars Weather API - a simple web app that displays the weather on Mars </br>
   <br>Watering plant reminder web app - Simple UI, stores different plants, informs user via notification (api) when to water. </br>
