# My Protfolio

## My portfolio has been developed over the past 2 months. 

For the moment, the portfolio includes a mix of *jquery* and *vanilla* javascript. 

**Projects currently being worked (in order of priority) are:**

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars Weather API - a simple web app that displays the weather on Mars </br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watering plant reminder web app - Simple UI, stores different plants, informs user via notification (api) when to water.
